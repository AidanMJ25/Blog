Hi, I'm Aidan.

This site started as an experiment in automation and Markdown, but it's slowly turned into a catalog of some of my nerdy adventures. 

I'm much more proud of how the sausage is made than the sausage itself. The posts here are just the by-product of a system I actually enjoy using.

For fun, I picked up my Apple Certified Technician and CompTIA A+ certifications. They have nothing to do with my day job, but I like learning how things work from the inside out.

This site is basically my nerdy RSS feed in public form. If you're into that, welcome.
