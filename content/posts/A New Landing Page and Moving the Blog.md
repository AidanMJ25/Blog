I finally have a proper home on the web — a simple, fast, no-nonsense landing page that ties 
everything together at [aidanmaurinjones.com](https://aidanmaurinjones.com).

Now the **landing page** handles introductions while the **blog** lives at 
[blog.aidanmaurinjones.com](https://blog.aidanmaurinjones.com), focused entirely on posts 
and projects.

## The Goal

I wanted something that:

- loads instantly
- works entirely from static files
- stays easy to maintain
- feels like me — straightforward, clean, and a little nerdy around the edges

No flashy animations, no bloat, no signup forms. Just a name, a short blurb, and a link to 
the blog.

---

## The Build

The site runs on [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) with the [Hermit-V2](https://github.com/1bl4z3r/hermit-V2) theme — lightweight, elegant, and fast.  
I kept the layout minimal: title, subtitle, one link to the blog, and a simple contact section.

Everything is built locally with Hugo Extended, then deployed automatically using GitHub Pages.  
Once the workflow was behaving, the entire site could rebuild and publish in under 30 seconds.

## The Result

What you see now is the distilled version of everything I wanted:  
a quiet, fast landing page that does exactly one job — introduce me and point you in the 
right direction.

It’s clean, responsive, and entirely under my control.  
No third-party builders, no analytics scripts, no compromises.

---

## Closing Thoughts

I didn’t rebuild the blog — I just gave it a better home.  
The content, feeds, and archives all live on at [blog.aidanmaurinjones.com](https://blog.aidanmaurinjones.com); 
the main domain is now a simple, focused landing page that introduces who I am and where to find my work.

It’s a small change that makes everything clearer and easier to manage — one site for reading, 
one site for meeting.
