Not every Shortcut has to be complex to be life-changing. Some of the best automations are 
the simplest ones--and my new Shortcut, Open Ride Share Apps, is a perfect example. It's 
literally just a launcher for Uber, Lyft, and Hopp. That's it. But in practice, it's saved 
me both time and a surprising amount of money.

----

### Why I Built It

When I need a ride, I almost never know which service will be cheapest or fastest. Sometimes 
Uber has the best price, sometimes Lyft does, and often Hopp beats them both. Checking each 
app manually meant digging through my Home Screen or Spotlight searching--friction that often 
made me default to just one app. That laziness cost me more than I realized.

----

### How the Shortcut Works

This is about as beginner-friendly as Shortcuts get. The flow is just:

- Open Uber
- Open Lyft
- Open Hopp

That’s it. No menus to build, no variables to configure, no scripting required. When I run 
the Shortcut, it simply opens all three apps in sequence. By the time I’m done glancing at 
Uber, Lyft, and Hopp, I know which one has the best deal.

### The Real Benefit

Because this Shortcut makes it effortless to compare services, I've gotten into the habit 
of checking all three every time I book a ride. The result? I almost always end up picking 
the cheapest option. Over time, those small savings really add up--I've already saved enough 
to cover multiple months of my phone bill just by avoiding surge pricing.

-----

### Why It Stands Out

The magic here isn't technical--it's behavioural. By lowering the friction to compare prices, 
the Shortcut nudges me into making better choices. It's a reminder that you don't need advanced 
automations or APIs to get value out of Shortcuts. Sometimes a handful of "Open App" actions 
can save you more money than the most complex setups.

If you've been curious about building your first Shortcut but felt intimidated, start here. 
It's dead simple, immediately useful, and might just pay for your next coffee--or your next 
month of rides.
